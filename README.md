# Description
**Libft** is the first major project in the 42 curriculum. The objective is to program a C library from scratch to create a collection of functions that can be reused in future projects.

## Instructions

### 1. Compilation
To compile the library, you can use the provided `Makefile`. Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

## Resources & Acknowledgements

### References
* **Linux Man Pages**: The absolute primary source of truth. Every function was implemented after carefully reading its manual entry (`man 3 <function>`) to replicate strict behavior, return values, and edge case handling.
* **Peer Learning**: A huge thanks to my fellow 42 students. The whiteboard sessions, code reviews, and debugging discussions were invaluable for understanding complex concepts like linked lists and memory leaks.
